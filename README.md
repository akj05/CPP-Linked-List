# üîó Linked Lists in C++

## üìö Overview

A **linked list** is a linear data structure where elements are stored in **nodes** connected using **pointers**. Unlike arrays, which use contiguous memory, linked lists use **non-contiguous memory**, allowing for **dynamic memory allocation**.

Each node in a **singly linked list** contains:
- `data`: The value to store.
- `next`: A pointer to the next node in the list.

---

## üß± Types of Linked Lists

### 1. Singly Linked List
- Each node points to the next node.
- Last node points to `nullptr`.
- Traversal is only **forward**.

```text
[Data|Next] -> [Data|Next] -> [Data|nullptr]
````

---

### 2. Doubly Linked List

* Each node has two pointers: `prev` and `next`.
* Supports **bidirectional traversal**.
* Requires more memory.

```text
nullptr <- [Prev|Data|Next] <-> [Prev|Data|Next] -> nullptr
```

---

### 3. Circular Linked List

* The last node connects back to the first node.
* Can be singly or doubly circular.
* Used in **cyclical data structures** like round-robin scheduling.

**Singly Circular:**

```text
[Data|Next] -> [Data|Next] -> [Data|Next]
      ^                             |
      |-----------------------------|
```

**Doubly Circular:**

```text
<-> [Data] <-> [Data] <-> [Data] <->
 ^                                 |
 |---------------------------------|
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Linked List vs Array

| Feature                | Array               | Linked List             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Memory Allocation      | Static (fixed size) | Dynamic                 |
| Memory Usage           | Contiguous          | Non-contiguous          |
| Insert/Delete (Middle) | O(n)                | O(1) (if pointer known) |
| Random Access          | O(1)                | O(n)                    |
| Insertion at End       | O(1) (amortized)    | O(n)                    |
| Insertion at Start     | O(n)                | O(1)                    |

## ‚úÖ Advantages of Linked Lists

* ‚úÖ Dynamic size ‚Äî grows and shrinks at runtime.
* ‚úÖ Efficient insertions and deletions.
* ‚úÖ No memory waste due to pre-allocation.

---

## ‚ùå Disadvantages of Linked Lists

* ‚ùå No random access ‚Äî must traverse to find elements.
* ‚ùå Extra memory for pointers.
* ‚ùå Slower traversal than arrays.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Real-World Applications

* üéµ Music playlists (next/previous song navigation)
* üåê Browser history (back/forward buttons)
* üíæ Dynamic memory management (heap structures)
* üßÆ Polynomial arithmetic (compiler-level operations)
* üîÑ Round-robin scheduling (CPU/task management)
* üåê Graphs using adjacency lists

---

## üß† Concept Summary

> A **linked list** is a chain of nodes connected via pointers.
> It's ideal when you need dynamic memory allocation, frequent insertions/deletions, or non-contiguous memory access.
